## Project Description

This project is an e-commerce store built using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. It is a single-page application that features a product listing, individual product pages, a shopping cart system, an auto-fill search bar, and a contact form. The store interacts with the Noroff Online Shop API to display real-time product data, enabling users to browse and search for items. Users can add products to their shopping cart and proceed to the checkout page. The contact form includes form validation, and the submitted data is logged in the console. The application is fully responsive, featuring client-side routing and a cart functionality.
